# **Tic Tac Toe Game**

A simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates basic web development skills, including event handling, dynamic UI updates, and game logic implementation.

---

## **Features**
- **Two-player game**: Players take turns marking the cells as `X` or `O`.
- **Win detection**: Highlights the winning combination when a player wins.
- **Draw detection**: Detects when the game ends in a draw.
- **Responsive design**: Works on various screen sizes.
- **Reset functionality**: Allows users to reset the game board and play again.

---

## **How to Play**
1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Player X starts first.
3. Players alternate turns, clicking on empty cells to place their symbol.
4. The game ends when:
   - One player achieves three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - All cells are filled without a winner (draw).
5. Click the "Reset Game" button to restart.
